## What Is This?

Scrapyard Signup is a deliberately infuriating login/signup page designed to challenge the very limits of patience. Every element has been  crafted to be as frustrating and annoying as possible while technically still being "functional" (in the loosest sense of the word).

## Features (or "Anti-Features")

- **Field Confusion**: Username field is actually the password field and vice versa
- **Marquee Everything**: Critical elements constantly move across the screen
- **Color Chaos**: Background colors and text colors randomly change every few seconds
- **Font Roulette**: Font family, size, and opacity randomly change
- **Color Verification**: Must match a randomly generated color code that's barely visible
- **Self-Erasing Password**: Your password input erases itself every 2 seconds
- **Insulting Support**: The support system only exists to roast users when they make mistakes
- **Field Switching**: Form fields switch positions and types after submission attempts
- **Unreadable Text**: Random opacity and color combinations ensure maximum illegibility
- **Impossible Validation**: Validation rules that are contradictory or extremely difficult to satisfy

## Test

1. Go To htps://protogen.live
2. Question your life choices

## Usage

1. Try to fill out the form
2. Fail repeatedly
3. Experience existential dread
4. ???
5. No profit. Only pain.

## Hidden Features

There may or may not be an "easy mode" hidden somewhere in the code. We're not saying it exists, but if it did, it might make things slightly less hellish. Good luck finding it.

## Why Does This Exist?

Because we hate websites that work normally <3
